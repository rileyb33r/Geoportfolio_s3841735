		This website is the geoportfolio of Riley Beer which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOM2116). This website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		I grew up in Torquay, Australia and as of September 2023, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Surveying) (Honours) Degree. I have interests in working within the surveying industry across a range of disaplines such as cadastral,  
		mining and remote sensing areas. My current Capstone Projects involve using SfM data collected from UAV to monitor coastal cliff movements along the 
		Surf Coast. I look forward to completing this project at the end of this semester and completing similar research projects out in the workforce.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies are motorbike riding, running and playing golf.

		Throughout my degree, I completed two Cartography units. The class assesments consisted of creating maps using various spatial data collected out in the field
		or sourced from opensource datasets from resources such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Throught the cartography courses I enjoyed the design
		and creativity aspect, and found I really enjoyed making maps. It something that as a surveyor you don't nessesarily get to experiment with plan/map design 
		so I found it very enjoyable and rewarding.
		
		<p>
			Below are some of the maps that I have created for assesments across my degree:

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) combined core geospacial science disaplines and combined it into one unit. The unit is very practical and 
		interesting as it goes through the whole process of a project, collecting the data, reducing the data, presenting the data, as seen below with the different images. 
		The subject covers areas from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			Unfortunately, we weren't able to collect our data due to the Covid Pandemic so our raw data was provided to us. The topographic map was created using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. 
			The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program ArcScene while the raw data was
			modified in ArcMap. The proposed pathway was created using ArcMap by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		I am currently completing a Capstone Project, which is required in your final year at RMIT, surrounding how structure from motion (SfM) techniques 
		can be used to montior cliff erosion and acreation along the Surf Coast. I have found it really challenging learning new concepts and using
		new programs such as CloudCompare, Pix4D and DroneDeploy. The project has allowed me to delve deep into the drone space as it is something that
		I find interesting and hope to persue later in my professional career. Below I have attached my Capstone Poster which introduces the main ideas 
		that the project aims to do.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2023) within the Surveying industry. I have worked at two companies Willis Setouts and 
		Surveys and am now currently working at Hamilton Land Surveyors. This page will outline the experience I have gained and skills I have learned during my time 
		at both companies with a brief overview of my role in each job.

	<div class="job-overview">
		During my third year of my studies of Bachelor of Applied Science I worked at Willis Setouts and
		Surveys as a student surveyor. I worked part time over the course of the year and gained experience
		in the construction surveying industry. I worked as part of a team that conducted slab set-outs for
		volume builders such as Metricon, Simmonds, Homebuyers Group and Boutique. During my time at
		Willis Setouts and Surveys I was exposed to Trimble total stations to complete field work and
		programmes such as lisCAD and AutoCAD.
		<p>
		I learnt a lot about reading builders floor plans and POS during my time at Willis. At the start I found
		the plans confronting and overwhelming as there’s a lot of information to sift through. I found I
		became more and more comfortable with interpreting plans and dissevering what I needed to
		complete the lisCAD plans correctly. I further improved my skills with lisCAD drafting and drew on
		skills I had learnt during my studies and developed new ones in areas that allowed me to complete
		tasks quickly. Such as using functions such as ‘Bearing and Distance’ commands when creating points
		at 90° of each other as well as other tips that I will carry throughout my professional career.
		<p>
		I worked for Willis for a year and found that during my time there I progressed quickly and learnt the
		process of creating a LisCAD plans, uploading jobs to the Total Station, completing set outs a at a
		rofessional standard and coming back to the office and uploading the completed job into the system.

		My title at Hamilton Land Surveyors is a Survey Technician which entails assisting the party leader during field days and create related plans within the office. The job allows exposure to  
		the cadastal side of surveying and gives me a different insight into the Surveying Industry to my previous employment. I have been really enjoying this disapline
		of surveying and have devoloped my skills in areas such as re-establishment surveys, feature and level surveys and experience in processes such as subdivisons
		and various other applications. 
		<p>
		I have enjoyed the field work that I have completed and have learnt alot of skills that I will carry into my professional career. I have gained alot of confidence
		and take alot of pride in my work. I look forward to taking on every oppertunity that presents itself and to continue to grow my knowledge across all fields of
		the surveying industry.
